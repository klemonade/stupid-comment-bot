# Noted from Lemonade >>

# I only build this tool for educational purpose only
# The users must bear with the consequences themselves as they are using this tool
# I will not be responsible to any of those

# For some of you that can do coding, I am here to ask you for help >>
# I wanted this code to be exit anytime the user press any key
# However, I do not know how to do it using pynput as it run seperately from the loop
# I will be so thankful to the person who can add this feature
# Thanks in advance and Good Luck with coding :D
