# Noted from Lemonade >>

I only build this tool for **educational purpose only**
The users **must bear with the consequences themselves** as they are using this tool
I will not be responsible to any of those

#####  For some of you that can do coding, *I am here to ask you for help* >>

I wanted this code to be exit anytime the user press any key
However, I do not know how to do it using pynput as it run seperately from the loop
I will be so thankful to the person who can add this feature

Thanks in advance and good luck with coding

May the force be with you
